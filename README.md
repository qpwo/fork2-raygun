[**updated build instructions!**](ubuntu-20-full-install.sh)

Raygun is a simplistic game engine built around [Vulkan Ray Tracing].
Therefore, a GPU supporting hardware ray tracing is required.

[PhysX] is used as physics engine, while [OpenAL] enables audio support.
For window and input management, [GLFW] is utilized.
Debugging and profiling information is displayed via [ImGui].
